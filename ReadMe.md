# R-Primers 

The goal of this project is to create a well-cataloged scripts (templates), so users can start a project with R quickly even when we are not (currently) familiar with R. The [Basic utility](https://github.com/weitingwlin/r-primers/tree/master/Documents#catalog-of-basic-utilities) would provide templates as modules, for small tasks. The [Task-Based Primers](https://github.com/weitingwlin/r-primers/tree/master/Documents#catalog-of-task-based-projects) would provide templates to perform certain tasks. With the **Basic utility** as knowledge base, we try to find the shortest and most painless path toward "doing something in R".

## How to use?

If you have R (and Rstudio) installed and have used it before, you can maybe find what you need in the **task-based primers**. Or play around **Basic utility** to refresh.

If you are totally new, see **Before coding** below and start with installing R.

### Before coding: install, get it all set
#### Step 1: Install [R](https://cran.rstudio.com/index.html)

#### Step 2: Install [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/home/)
Rstudio makes R much easier to use, and all the examples in this repo were done with Rstudio. (Actually I don't know how to work with the naked R, so...)

#### Step 3: Learn how it works
* Learn how to [work in Rstudio](https://github.com/weitingwlin/r-primers/blob/master/Documents/Working_with_Rstudio.md), tell R to do somthing for you with **commands**. 
* Learn how to [working with scripts and .R files](https://github.com/weitingwlin/r-primers/blob/master/Documents/Working_with_scripts.md), so you can keep track of your commands, and actually start **coding**. 
 
#### Step 4: Prepare a project folder
* Prepare a folder (anywhere on your computer) for your project
* [Set up working environment](Documents/Set_up_working.md) 

#### Step 5: Climb on!
 With these skills you should be able to play through the examples in [Basic utility](https://github.com/weitingwlin/r-primers/tree/master/Documents#catalog-of-basic-utilities), and learn R at your own pace. 

 Or you might try a **top-down method**, start working on a [Task-Based Primers](https://github.com/weitingwlin/r-primers/tree/master/Documents#catalog-of-task-based-projects), and click-learn everything you need on the way.
